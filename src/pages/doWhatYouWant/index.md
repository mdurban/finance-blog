Spend money on what you want.
If you want a McMansion in 2 years, put your money in bonds or a CD and cut back your other spending.
If you want to save money for traveling, cut back on your $30 eating out bills that you're spending three times a week.
If you wished you lived in small cabin in the woods, why are you living in a $400,000 house in the suburbs?

Money is personal and you shouldn't compare your spending/saving habits with others. Spend money on what you want and save money for your personal goals.
