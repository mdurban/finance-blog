**Creating a budget** is the first step required when getting finances in order. In this article, I'll outline the steps that I took in this process and highlight the importance of a budget in your financial strategy.

## Figure out how much you're bringing in
Take a look at your paystubs to how much money your family is bringing it each month. Make sure you're looking at your (and your spouse, if married) net pay, as this accounts for expenses like taxes and health insurance costs that you should not take into account when determining how much your bringing home each month.

## Figure out how much you're spending on essentials
This is the same exercise you do when determining [how much you need for your emergency fund](). Don't forget about to include all essentials you need, including bills that are not monthly (such as home/auto insurance).

## Figure out what's important to you
Giving/charity. Entertainment.

## Track your budget
I like to use a tool for tracking my budget. Some of the most popular choices are [Personal Capital](), [Mint](), [Every Dollar](https://www.everydollar.com/) and [You Need A Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/).

I personally use Personal Capital. It is free to use and offers a ton of features outside of just budget tracking. It creates a central place to keep track of all your bank accounts, retirement accounts, loans, investing portfolio and more. It also has a pretty nice Retirement Planner built it. If you would like to try it out, use [this referral link]() and we both get a $20 Amazon gift card! (see [disclosure]() about my use of affiliate links)

Keep it automated.
