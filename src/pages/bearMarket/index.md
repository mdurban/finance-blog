**In the face of COVID-19**, the U.S. economy is in its first [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/digging-deeper-bull-and-bear-markets/) in over a decade. Sounds scary (and it kinda is) but it's a fancy way of saying that the stock market has dropped a significant amount.

During this time, people wonder what to do with their money and how to change their financial strategy. As always, instead of telling you what you should do, I'll walk through what I'm personally doing and why.

## Make Sure My Emergency Fund is Secure
With unemployment rates hitting astronomical levels during this time, the first thing I did was make sure that I had a good amount in my [emergency fund](https://moneyfornoobs.com/emergencyFund). The recommended amount of 3 - 6 months of living expenses is a good target but I wanted to beef it up a bit during this time. Just in case I lose my job or end up getting sick, I wanted a larger pile of cash to rely on. With everything going on during this crazy time I didn't want finances to be yet another stressor to add to life.

## Continue My Automated Investing Strategy
It's easy to look at the stock prices dropping and think, "I'm selling all my stocks and not putting anymore into the market until things settle down". But this is why I automate my investing strategy. While my contributions happen automatically I don't need to constantly look at how much money I've lost in my 401(k) account.

I feel like a down market is the perfect time to buy stocks, at least for my long-term time horizon accounts, because I'm essentially getting them "on sale". Over time, after the market recovers (as it has recovered from every recession in history), I'm hoping to look back at this time and be glad I invested when I did. I actually increased my contributions to my long-term accounts to take advantage of the current low costs.

## Help Those in Need
This is the perfect time to help those less fortunate than myself. While I continue to get my normal paycheck, as well as government stimulus checks, my personal financial situation hasn't changed much (as long as I don't look at my retirement funds). But with so many people losing their jobs, getting sick and trying to provide for their families in a world where there is already such an enormous wealth divide, I'm happy to help those who need financial assistance to keep on keeping on.

## Wrapping Up
I am grateful to have resisted the temptation of halting my retirement contributions (or worse, cashing out) in the face of my funds plummeting. During this time I'm sticking to the practices that I've put in place. Everything I've done with setting up my financial strategy has just been practice for times like this, so I'm going to just let things ride out.

Stay healthy and thanks for reading!
