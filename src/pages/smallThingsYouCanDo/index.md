People frequently ask me about practical things they can do to save money. While I understand that I live rather frugally (fine, cheap), I'm not eating-Ramen-for-every-meal frugal.

## Shop for Home and Auto Insurance
I had standard car and home insurance through State Farm that I set up when I bought my house. I never shopped around to try and get the cheapest policies that I could and I was pretty oblivious as to what kind of insurance I even had. I just trusted the insurance company to take care of this and not screw me over.

I was so naive...

Earlier this year when I started researching personal finance, I went through the process of tracking all of my expenses. When I got to my insurance I realized that it seemed high. Like, really high. So I started shopping around and getting quotes and realized that I was wrong. My insurance prices weren't just high. They were astronomical.

So I switched. It was kinda a pain but well worth it. I will be saving around $900 a year on my insurance policies this year and almost identical coverage.

## High Interest Savings Accounts
I covered this in my article about [creating an emergency fund](https://moneyfornoobs.com/emergencyFund) so I will just touch on it here. Make sure that your savings account is earning you close to 2% or more on interest. If you're in the majority of people and earning less than 0.1%, it's time to switch banks.


## Cancel Subscriptions You Are Not Using
This may seem simple but a lot of people like to collect monthly subscriptions. $8 a month doesn't seem like a lot when putting together your budget. But when you have 5 different subscription services you'll soon start to see how much you're spending.

I'm not saying you shouldn't have any subscriptions accounts. Just make sure you know exactly how much of your budget is being eaten up by these monthly payments. Take some time to determine whether you actually use that account enough to justify the price. Most people don't need cable, Netflix, Disney+ and Hulu because watching that much TV is impossible.

## Watch How Much You Spend on Eating Out
Eating out at restaurants gets really expensive, really quick. A lot of people don't realize how often they're eating out and how much it's costing them. Track how much you're spending on this per month and determine if you can cut back. Eating out once or twice a week will probably save you quite a bit of money.

## Be on the Lookout for Company HSA/FSA Plans
Check to see if your company offers an HSA (Health Savings Account) for your health insurance options. This will save you money on your healthcare as the money you put into your HSA is pre-tax.

Some companies offer some kind of FSA (Flexible Spending Account) for health insurance or childcare. Contributions to this account are also not taxed so can be used to save money on things that you're going to be spending money on anyways
