People frequently ask me about practical things they can do to save money. While I understand that I live rather frugally (fine, cheap), I'm not eating-Ramen-for-every-meal-frugal.

## Shop for Home and Auto Insurance
I had standard car and home insurance through State Farm that I set up when I bought my house. I never shopped around to try and get the cheapest policies that I could and I was pretty oblivious as to what kind of insurance I even had. I just trusted the insurance company to take care of this and not screw me over.

I was so naive...

Earlier this year, when I started researching personal finance, I went through the process of tracking all of my expenses. When I got to my insurance, I realized that it seemed high. Like, really high. So I started shopping around and getting quotes and realized that I was wrong. My insurance prices weren't high. They were astronomical.

So I switched. It was kinda a pain but well worth it. I will be saving around $900 a year on my insurance policies this year.

## High Interest Savings Accounts
I covered this in my article about [creating an emergency fund](https://moneyfornoobs.com/emergencyFund), so I will just touch on hit here. Make sure that your savings account is earning you close to 2% or more on interest. If you're in the majority of people and earning less thatn 0.1%, it's time to switch banks.


## Cancel Subscriptions You Are Not Using
This may seem simple but a lot of people like to collect monthly subscriptions. $8 a month doesn't seem like a lot when putting together your budget. But when you have 5 different subscription services you'll soon start to see how much you're spending.

I'm not saying you shouldn't have any subscriptions accounts. Just make sure you know exactly how much of your budget is being eaten up by these monthly payments. Take some time to determine whether you actually use that account enough to justify the price. Most people don't need cable, Netflix and Hulu because watching that much TV is impossible.
