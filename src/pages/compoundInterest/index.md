An **emergency fund** is just the money you have set aside that you only use in case of emergency (i.e. home/car repairs, medical emergency, unexpected job loss). You should consider prioritize building your emergency fund up before doing anything else with your money. Paying off student loans faster or contributing more to your retirement accounts are great financial strategies, but I believe that having an emergency fund secured is the number one priority.

## How Much to Keep Aside for Emergencies

To start, aim to save at least a couple thousand dollars for emergencies. After that, try building up to a few months worth of expenses. Most people recommend that you should keep 3 - 6 months of cash in an accessible place (most likely a savings account with your bank).

Determining exactly how much 3 - 6 months worth of cash changes on the person and will require you do to some homework. You need to sit down and figure out how much you spend on the bare necessities each month. Don't count your monthly Spotify or Netflix fees as these subscriptions can be canceled in case of an emergency, but don't forget things like internet that will be necessary if searching for a new job.

This amount was higher than I expected when initially going through this process, but it will be a nice peace of mind to know that you have it set aside.

## Where to Keep Your Emergency Fund

Make sure that you're keeping your emergency fund in an *easily accessible* spot, such as a savings account. You need to have immediate access to your money. This is called [liquid](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) funds. This money can be taken out at any time and be used for spending immdiately.

I use my bank's savings account for my emergency funds. I keep 6 months of cash in there at all times in case of an emergency, and hopefully I'll never need to touch it. The interest that my savings account provides just adds extra padding to my emergency account.

## Choosing a Bank for Your Emergency Fund

Most people keep their money with big banks (such as Chase). For long-term savings accounts, such as your emergency account, I would look towards high-interest, online banks. The bigger banks usually don't offer nearly as much growth on your savings. For example, before switching banks, I was using Chase who offers 0.01% interest. This isn't even enough to keep up with inflation, so I was actually losing money.

I personally use [Ally](https://www.ally.com/), but there are many options out there. Looks for any bank that offers at least 2% APY and make sure that the bank is FDIC-insured. This means that, in the case that the bank collapses, the federal government pays you back your money (up to $250,000).

Other things to keep in mind with online banks are to look at monthly fees. Most banks don't have these or will waive them if you opt into their paperless options for quarterly statements, but some have these fees that may not me initially obvious. Also be sure to check if the savings account has a minimum account balance that you'll need to meet.

## Maintaining Emergency Funds Balance

After you've saved the amount you're comfortable with for your emergency funds, congratulations! You're all done. Don't touch the funds and just let it sit there gaining (hopefully more than 2%) interest.
