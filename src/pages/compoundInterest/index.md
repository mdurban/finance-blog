**Compound interest** is the tenth wonder of the world. When looking at the numbers, it can seem like magic.

## The Rule of 72

Using the [rule of 72](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-rule-of-72-how-can-it-help-you-double-your-money-453756), you can see how quickly your savings can grow (and how many times it can double!).

For example, if your money is invested at a 7% percent return (which most retirement plans can hit with a hands-off approach), your money will double in just over 10 years.

An example to help illustrate this. If you contribute $100,000 to your retirement by the age of 40

## Market Volatility

Keep in mind that these numbers show the *average*. The stock market fluctuates quite a bit, and there will be down years to go along with your up years. This is why I like my investment strategies to be as hands-off as possible. I don't want to deal with the stress.

## Choosing a Bank for Your Emergency Fund

Most people keep their money with big banks (such as Chase). For long-term savings accounts, such as your emergency account, I would look towards high-interest, online banks. The bigger banks usually don't offer nearly as much growth on your savings. For example, before switching banks, I was using Chase who offers 0.01% interest. This isn't even enough to keep up with inflation, so I was actually losing money.

I personally use [Ally](https://www.ally.com/), but there are many options out there. Looks for any bank that offers at least 2% APY and make sure that the bank is FDIC-insured. This means that, in the case that the bank collapses, the federal government pays you back your money (up to $250,000).

Other things to keep in mind with online banks are to look at monthly fees. Most banks don't have these or will waive them if you opt into their paperless options for quarterly statements, but some have these fees that may not me initially obvious. Also be sure to check if the savings account has a minimum account balance that you'll need to meet.

## Maintaining Emergency Funds Balance

After you've saved the amount you're comfortable with for your emergency funds, congratulations! You're all done. Don't touch the funds and just let it sit there gaining (hopefully more than 2%) interest.
