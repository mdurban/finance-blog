A **401(k)** is an American retirement savings plan that is offered by many traditional employers. These accounts (along with [IRAs](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/learn-about-ira-accounts)) are used by many as the backbone of retirement savings plans. They generally have good long-term growth because they are invested in stocks and/or bonds. Investing sounds scary and a lot of people try to stay away from the term,  but if you're contributing to your retirement account then you are most likely investing without even knowing it!

## How to Save for Retirement
When contributing to your workplace's 401(k) retirement account, you will need to choose what percentage of your paycheck you want to go into your retirement account. You may need to reach out to your employer to learn how to contribute to your 401(k) account.

After selecting how much you want to contribute, you will need to decide where you want this money to go. Figuring out how you want your retirement money invested can be daunting to many. For this, I would recommend reaching out to a financial advisor.

The way I approach investing my 401(k) funds is by picking a simple, long-term, hands-off allocation strategy. Some 401(k) plans offer a [target date fund](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/basics/investment-products/target-date-funds). These funds provide a diversified investment strategy based on your projected retirement year and can offer a nice approach for many people (like myself) who don't want to get into the nitty gritty of investing and keeping up with changing their allocations. While these may not be the best investment strategy for you, they provide a simple way to invest your retirement funds without researching all of your investment options.

Some accounts will have a default investing strategy and some won't be invested at all (which is a problem if you expect any kind of growth). Make sure that you know exactly how your contributions are being invested.

## How Much to Contribute
Many companies offer some sort of employer matching program for employee 401(k) accounts. My personal rule of thumb is to start by aiming to contribute the amount that your company will match. For example, if my employer matches 4% then I would contribute (at least) 4% of my paycheck. Contributing anything less is essentially leaving free money on the table. I like free money, so I max out the money I can get from my employer's match.

While probably unlikely early in your career, a good long-term goal is to get to the point where you're contributing $19,000 per year into your 401(k) account. For 2019, that is the maximum allowed by the IRS. Don't feel like you're behind if you can't come close to hitting this, though, as a very small percentage of people are actually maxing out their retirement contributions. But if you're an over-achiever and still want to contribute more there are always Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) that allow for up to $6,000 extra in contributions per year.

Hitting $19,000 seems very intimidating to me and is impossible for many, but contributing anything more than what your company matches is great. Once you understand compound interest, you'll understand how important contributing to your retirement account is. You will be shocked at how much your retirement savings will grow when doing simple calculations on a retirement calculator. And because of this growth, although it's never too late to start contributing, the younger you are when you begin contributing, the better. Using the [rule of 72](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-rule-of-72-how-can-it-help-you-double-your-money-453756), you can see how quickly your savings can grow (and how many times it can double!).

I personally prioritize contributing to my retirement accounts fairly high. I always try to at least get my company match. After that, I like to start contributing even more to my retirement accounts after finishing up [building an emergency fund](https://moneyfornoobs.com/emergencyFund) and paying off any high-interest loans.

## Traditional? Roth?
There are two main types of 401(k) accounts: **Traditional** and **Roth**. It is becoming increasingly popular for employers to offer both of these options. When choosing which one you want to contribute to, I recommend consulting a financial advisor to determine which is better for your personal situation. Some employers may even offer an advisor when trying to figure out retirement contributions.

The [difference](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/traditional-401k-vs-roth-401k) between Traditional and Roth accounts revolve around when those contributions are taxed.
- In a Traditional account, your contributions go in tax free but are taxed when you take the money out in retirement. This can help reduce your taxable income.
- In a Roth account, your contributions go in after paying taxes but they are taken out tax-free in retirement. This money also grows tax-free.

## Vesting
Another important topic when considering how to approach your 401(k) accounts is the [vesting schedule](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/401k-vesting-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/). Vesting refers to how much of your company match you get to take with you when you leave your company.

If you're 100% vested, you get to keep *all* employer match contributions when you leave. If you're not completely vested then you may not get to keep it all. You need to look into your company's vesting schedule for the details as all companies are different. Some may do a percentage-based schedule. For example, if you leave the company while being 40% vested, you will get to take 40% of your company's match with you.

Regardless of your vesting status, you always get to keep the money that you contributed yourself.

## Accessing your Retirement Funds
My rule of thumb is to not take any money out of 401(k) accounts prior to retirement except in dire emergencies (this is why you worked so hard on building up your emergency funds!). If you have to access your retirement funds early then the IRS hit you with a pretty large fee. This also will leave you with less in your retirement account to earn that huge growth potential.

## Wrapping Up
While aiming for the max contribution limit can seem unrealistic right now, I always try to get my company match. If that's not possible at this stage of life, just contributing anything can go a long way and helps build good financial habits. And if you contribute an extra, you're ahead of the curve and setting yourself up for a nice nest egg in retirement!
