A **401(k)** is an American retirement account that is offered by many traditional employers. These accounts, along with IRA accounts, are used by many as the backbone of their retirement savings plans. These accounts generally have good long-term growth because they are invested in stocks and/or bonds. Investing sounds scary and a lot of people try to stay away from the term,  but if you're contributing to your retirement account, you are most likely investing without even knowing it!

## How to Save for Retirement

You may need to reach out to your employer to learn how to contribute to your 401(k) account. Usually, you can select a percentage of however much you want to be taken out of eaach paycheck to go into your retirement account.

After selecting how much you want to contribute, you will need to decide how you want this money invested. For this, I would recommend reaching out to a fiduciary financial advisor.

Some accounts will have a default investing strategy, such as investing in a [target date fund](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/basics/investment-products/target-date-funds). This will give you a diversified investment strategy based on the year that you are projected to retire and can offer a nice hands-off approach for many people (like myself) who don't want to get into the nitty gritty of investing.

## How Much to Contribute

My personal rule of thumb is to start by aiming to contribute the least amount that your company will match. For example, your employer may match up to 4% of your paycheck. In this case, I would contribute (at least) 4% of my paycheck to my 401(k) account. Contributing anything less is essentially leaving free money on the table. I like free money, so I max out the money I can get from my employer's match.

Contributing anything more than what your company matches is great. Once you understand compound interest, you'll understand how important contributing to your retirment account is. You will be shocked at how much your retirment savings will grow when doing simple calculations on a retirment calculator. And because of this growth, although it's never too late to start contributing, the earlier the better. Using the [rule of 72](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-rule-of-72-how-can-it-help-you-double-your-money-453756), you can see how quickly your savings can grow (and how many times it can double!).

I personally prioritize contributing to my retirement accounts fairly high. I would always try to get my company match. After that, I like to start contributing even more to my retirement accounts after finishing up building an emergency fund and paying off any high-interest rate loans.

## Traditional? ROTH?

You may have heard the terms **Traditional** or **ROTH** regarding retirment accounts, and your employer may even offer both for your 401(k) accounts. When choosing which one, I recommend consulting a financial advisor. Some employers may even offer an advisor when trying to figure out retirment contributions.

The difference between Traditional and ROTH accounts are just when the money that you contribute is being taxed:
-  In a Traditional account, your contributions go in tax free, but you are taxed when you take the money out in retirement.
- In a ROTH account, your contributions go in after paying taxes, but they are taken out tax-free in retirement.

## Accessing your Retirement Funds

Final note on retirement accounts. I strongly suggest that you do not take any money out of your accounts prior to retirement, except in dire emergencies (this is why you worked so hard on building up your emergency funds!). If you have to access your retirement funds early, the IRS hit you with a pretty large fee. This also will leave you with less in your retirement account to earn that huge growth potential.
